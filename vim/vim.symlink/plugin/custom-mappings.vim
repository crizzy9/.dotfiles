" The mark should stay at the same place but instead its shifting a bit

" while staying in insert mode

" The mark should stay at the same place.

" Custom mapping for replacing word without storing in register
" In future map it with a motion command instead of word to delete a certain
" thing and paste something you copied elsewhere in place. unless you find a
" better way to do this

" Allow numbers to move multiple
" <?num?> + <Space> + h : Move element left
" <?num?> + <Space> + l : Move element right

" *<?num?> + <Space> + h : Remove right most element
" *<?num?> + <Space> + h : Add left most element
" *<?num?> + <Space> + h : Add right most element
" This is very buggy improve and use text objects
" Cannot move the first word right and last word left like this. Also cant
" move second word into the first one and vice versa
" When on second word and trying to move it left it gets deleted?
" ['word1', 'word2', 'word3', 'word 4', word5, 'word6', 'word7']
